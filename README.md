# personal-portfolio

## Description

I created this personal portfolio to display my previous projects so that potential employers can see what I have accomplished. In addition to my projects, employers can also learn more about me and get in contact. Creating this portfolio helped solve the problem of having many projects stored in different places where not everyone can see them. Additionally, I wanted this portfolio to have a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport. This is important because my portolio may be viewed on different types of devices. While working on this project, I learned how to use the root selector and css variables. I also familiarized myself with media queries.

## Usage

When a viewer loads this personal portfolio in their browser, they will first see a navigation bar and a home screen. The navigation bar can be used to automatically scroll to different sections of the portfolio. These sections include: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. When in the Projects section, users can view my past projects in live browsers by clicking on the respective box. Lastly, when viewers go to the Contact section, they can hover over the options to email me, view my GitHub, or connect on Linkedin. These items highlight when hovered over.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
